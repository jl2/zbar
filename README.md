### _Jeremiah LaRocco <jeremiah_larocco@fastmail.com>_

This is an incomplete binding to the [ZBar](http://zbar.sourceforge.net/) library for scanning
barcodes.

The goal, for now, is to wrap enough of the library to allow scanning barcodes from OpenCV images created
with [CommonCV](https://github.com/byulparan/common-cv).

For complete information about using this binding, see ZBar's [C API Documentation](http://zbar.sourceforge.net/api/zbar_8h.html)
